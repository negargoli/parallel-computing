REVERSE TIME MIGRATION (RTM)
RTM is a technique for creating images based on sensor data to improve seismic interpretation done by geophysics. It is used to help oil and gas industry to recover an accurate representation of the subsurface.
It is a memory intensive and highly parallel algorithm; today GPUs are part of the solution for computing this algorithm. In this project this algorithm is implemented by pthread and MPI and OpenMP to reduce the runtime.
